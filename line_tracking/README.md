# line_tracking
## Description
This part of codes can keep tracking of lines

## Usage
Require MATLAB to run. <br>
run ```main.m```

## Expected Results  
As is shown in the line-tracking section in the presentation, a line should be tracking across multiple frames. A LineTracker object would record the line tracking result. To visualize it, check *visualize.m* and *visualize.m*
