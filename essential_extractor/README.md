# essential_extractor
## Description
This part of codes can extract the essetial matrix and the camera transformation matrix between 2 adjacent images.
## Usage
Require MATLAB to run.  
Run ```src\main.m``` to extract the essential matrices and the camera transformation matrices between 2 extracted frames. Run ```src\visualization.m``` to see the trajectory result.
## Expected Results
